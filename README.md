# Netpbm C Graphing Library
## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Purpose
This library is just a fun project that came to mind after learning about the
netpbm file format.  This format is realatively eary to understand and format.
Additionally, this format is supported by many pdf readers.  This file format
is generally just for quick graphical debugging due to its uncompressed nature,
however this project is just to test what it would take to write a simple
graphing program in C.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) is the wikipedia page for netpbm.
