# Netpbm C Graphing Library
## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Purpose
The idea of this project is to make a `plot` function in C that will take the
user's input (either a functions or collection of points) and generate a graph
similar to how easy it is with python or MATLAB.

The file format used to make the graph is the netpbm format. This format is
supported by many pdf readers.  This file format is good for quick graphical
debugging due to its uncompressed nature, however this also leads to larger
file sizes. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) is the wikipedia 
page for the netpbm file format, I found it quite helpful.
